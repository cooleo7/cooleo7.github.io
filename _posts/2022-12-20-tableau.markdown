We can identify which customers are likely to leave the bank through various ML & DL methods. It is crucial that banks conduct more thorough data analysis. The purpose of this project is to learn something new through careful data analysis such as __Binomial Logistic Regression.__

The goal of this project is finding out the accuracy of prediction depending on the condition in experiments. The project will be consist of 4 parts:
* EDA (Explatory Data Analysis)
* Method explanation
* The condition in experiment
* Result

## EDA - Data preprocessing

*Data Structure*

1. Data encoding
   
   Some variables are categorical, so I converted them to binary values. To apply cat- egorization issues, this is crucial (for instance, nation and
   gender). I consequently developed new features like country GE, country FR, country SP, and gender M and gender F.
   
2. Data scaling
   
   I used log transformation and standardisation to change the featuresâ€™ scale.
   
3. Relation between variables

   As illustrated in Figure 1 below, I discovered that age, country GE, balance, and active member have better correlations with churn than other factors.
   I chose these four features as the main features as a result.

4. Data Drop & replacement
   
   Since age contains certain outliers, as shown in (a) below, I tried to remove them and also did so for only churn=1. As can be seen in (b) below, there    are a lot of 0 values. I replaced these 0 values with a mean of balance.

## The concept of algorithm

I tried separating train data and test data with 5-Fold cross validation to prevent the interruption from biased data and increase the accuracy of a model.
Below is a classification of regression as a special case.

## Conditions in experiment
I tried to apply each case below to the model.

## Result
The accuracy is negatively impacted by the log transform, as can be shown in Table 1 below. In comparison to the original features, the model with features that excluded outliers is more accurate except the features log transformed. The model with features that eliminated age outliers and changed 0 values to the balance mean produced the best results, in particular as shown Table 1.

I drew graph (Figure 2) to demonstrate how effectively this model (case 18) predicted labels. Since the value of y is greater than 0.5 as indicated by the idea 3.1.1 section above, orange dots that are beyond the green line are assigned the label 1. Additionally, the orange dots below the green line are classified to label 0.
