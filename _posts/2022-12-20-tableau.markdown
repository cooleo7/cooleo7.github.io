This data pertains to energy information by countries worldwide from 1962 to 2023. In this project, I focus on access to electricity, CO2 emissions, electricity production, energy use, forest area, fossil fuel energy consumption, methane emissions, and renewable energy consumption. I refer to these as series names defined in this dataset.

The dashboard consists of 5 parts:
1. The world map by series name
2. Top 20 countries in the filtered series name
3. The change amount of the filtered country and series name between 1962 and 2023
4. The proportion of series name in the filtered country
5. The heat map between series names in the filtered country

I set the filter by series name. This filter is applied to the world map and bar chart. When you select one bar in a bar chart, this action applies to other charts such as the world map, line chart, bubble chart, and heatmap by filtering the country you select in the bar chart. You can simulate it using the dashboard link below.

## From the analysis in this dataset, I've gained some insights:
1. There is a strong correlation between CO2 emissions and Methane emissions.
2. Electricity production from coal sources shows a strong correlation with fossil fuel energy consumption.
3. Renewable energy consumption is closely related to forest area.
4. Most African countries consume a significant amount of renewable energy, and we can also observe that these African countries have more forest areas than other countries.
5. CO2 emissions have remained unchanged since the 1990s, while electricity production from coal sources gradually increased from the 1960s, remaining at the same level since the 1990s. Fossil fuel energy consumption has been increasing steadily. Renewable energy consumption began in the 1990s, whereas fossil fuel energy consumption started in the 1960s.
