This data relates to loans. Most often, a loan is necessary for our survival. The more personal information we collect, the more we take into account each person’s credit condition. To reduce risk, it is crucial for banks and the entire nation. People obtain this kind of data because of that. This report’s goal is to gain insight through data analysis, with a particular emphasis on data visualisation and correlation analysis.

The project will be consist of 5 parts:
* Data Overview
* Data Analysis
* Partial Data Analysis
* Conclusion
* Addtional Analysis


## Data Overview
1. Data preparation
   I obtained this dataset from Kaggle. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishaj225/loancsv/code?datasetId=1198164">here</a>
2. Data Description
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/25.png" width="100%" height="80%"></p>
Since each of the 614 Loan ID has a unique value, Loan ID is a key column. The target variable is Loan Status. Each column has a few tiny nan values. I preprocessed nan value data to allow for more precise data analysis. I’ll go into detail in the section after this.


## Data Analysis
1. Data preprocessing
   1.1 Null value preprocessing
   At first, I plotted histograms about the count of Loan Status by each categorical vari- able. Since each column contains a small number of null values, I replaced null values with the values which are the most frequent. (For instance, Gender = ’Male’, Married = ’Yes’ etc) I switched out null values for mean values when dealing with continuous variables. (For instance, LoanAmount = mean(LoanAmount))
   1.2 Data type preprocessing
   Since these are not continuous, I changed the types of Loan Amount Term, and Credit History from float to string.
   1.3 Derived variables
   Several derived variables, including Income, Ratio Loan, trans loan Status, Binned IC, and Binned LA, were generated by me. In the part after this, I shall describe these derived variables.
